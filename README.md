 Hobby project to learn more about .NET APIs and Blazor.
 I learned how to deploy WASM Blazor to gh pages, even using actions. Wow.
 Oh yes, this repo deploys code pushed to main automagically to gh-pages, with all the necessary changes (see main.yaml of the deploy action)

## Current (any only) Functionality
